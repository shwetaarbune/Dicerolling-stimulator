# Dicerolling-stimulator
To import the random library we use the import random code at the beginning of our program. The random library needs to be imported before we use the random library. 
We will set the minimum and maximum values of the random number to 1 and 6. We will use variables to store the minimum and maximum values. This will allow us to modify it later if we add on to our code.
we can use the randint() function in the random library to generate a random variable. The randint() function takes as parameters the minimum and maximum value of the randomly generated value and outputs a random integer between the minimum and maximum values.
